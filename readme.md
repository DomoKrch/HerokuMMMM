# Bot for friend's Discord server

Very amateur attempt at rapidly coding up a bot that can respond to "not-so-nice" words with particular phrases my friend at that time wanted the bot to respond with. I still don't get what's with the name "kardaism", you can ask him. 
Probably something to do with Kardashians.
